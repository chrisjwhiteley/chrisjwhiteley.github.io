      <description>A race report should probably be written in the days or weeks that follow a race. This one took place nearly 9 months ago but I hope someone will still be able to find some value in these ramblings.
In June 2019 I raced the Blenheim Palace Triathlon, my first triathlon of any length and, at the time, one of the most physically demanding activities I had undertaken. I was never overly athletic growing up, running didn&#39;t come naturally to me and whilst very comfortable in water, I certainly wasn&#39;t winning any races in the pool.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of years i&#39;ve realised the power of speaking something into existence. This has mainly manifested itself in sporting goals but I think it&#39;s applicable to all areas of life. The accountability that you gain from putting your goals and ambitions out there for the world to see, really can&#39;t be understated. So here are my goals for 2020!
Tech Goals  Release Subtle Sports open-source..This is a project that I started over the summer when the Cricket World Cup was on.</description>

      <description>Cornwall, 2018  Hi, my name is Chris Whiteley and this is my personal blog, or to be more accurate a collection of ramblings on unconnected topics with the aim to provide some small sliver of value to someone, somewhere.
