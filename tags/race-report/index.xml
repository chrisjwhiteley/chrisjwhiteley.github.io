      <description>A race report should probably be written in the days or weeks that follow a race. This one took place nearly 9 months ago but I hope someone will still be able to find some value in these ramblings.
In June 2019 I raced the Blenheim Palace Triathlon, my first triathlon of any length and, at the time, one of the most physically demanding activities I had undertaken. I was never overly athletic growing up, running didn&#39;t come naturally to me and whilst very comfortable in water, I certainly wasn&#39;t winning any races in the pool.</description>
