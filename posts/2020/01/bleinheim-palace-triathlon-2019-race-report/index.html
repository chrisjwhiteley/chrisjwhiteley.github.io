                <p>A race report should probably be written in the days or weeks that follow a race. This one took place nearly 9 months ago but I hope someone will still be able to find some value in these ramblings.</p>
<p>In June 2019 I raced the Blenheim Palace Triathlon, my first triathlon of any length and, at the time, one of the most physically demanding activities I had undertaken. I was never overly athletic growing up, running didn't come naturally to me and whilst very comfortable in water, I certainly wasn't winning any races in the pool. In 2018 I decided I would enter a 1 mile swimming race with a friend of mine. At the time this seemed truly bonkers but having survived the ordeal the natural progression seemed to be a sprint triathlon, and so on the 1st of June 2019 I found myself wheeling a bike into the grounds of Blenheim Palace, ready to race.</p>
<p>All my training for the race can be found on my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/19465229">Strava</a> profile along with my activities for the actual race which are linked below.</p>
<p><em>A note on travel to the race: I was travelling from London where people don't necessarily have cars. I thought I would be able to get a train and then find my way to the palace from Oxford. I was mistaken. After being thrown off the train I had initially booked for &lsquo;vandalising the seats&rsquo; (having my bike on board), I eventually managed to get on another train that got me to Oxford, I then ended up in a hugely overpriced taxi in order to get to the Palace grounds. Long story short, it's best to drive, rent a car if you don't have one!</em></p>
<p>The event was fantastically organised. After passing through the check in area I was told to drop my bike off in transition. At this point it became clear just how much of an experience range there was at this event. Some people were racing on £10,000 bikes whilst others were using mountain bikes which had clearly seen better days. After dropping my bike off and organising all my kit I went to get changed and before I knew it, it was time to get in the water and get racing.</p>
<p><img src="https://chriswhiteley.co.uk/Blenheim/transition.jpg" alt="Strava Swim Course"></p>
<p>The swim course was shaped like a number 7; starting from a floating start there was a long straight out followed by a short section back to the shore. I'd been told previously to take it easy on the swim and this is precisely what I did. Many people are surprised by how violent a triathlon swim can be but I managed to navigate this one without getting kicked in the face or ribs. Getting out of the water I felt fresh and ready to attack the rest of the course. The notorious climb up the hill to transition was a good opportunity for me to catch back up to people who had gone off hard in the swim and after a quick transition I was onto the bike. 1st leg successfully navigated!</p>

<p>Riding a bike in a wet trisuit was a new experience for me which was only made more pronounced by the initial downhill section out of the palace. Luckily the sun was beating down and within 5 minutes I was dry again. The bike course was hillier than I had expected although not unreasonably so. The course takes a loop of the palace estate and whilst perfectly pleasant, there are no views because you are in trees for most of the course. On the bike was where the gulf in class between athletes became very apparent with some athletes struggling to deal with the differing speeds. The 3 loop, 20km bike leg was over before I knew it and I was being directed back into transition to get changed into running shoes ready to take on the run.</p>

<p>The run was where I knew I could empty myself in search of glory. It's a 5km course which means full gas from start to finish! The route is 2 loops around a portion of the lake. There are aid stations at 1.5km, 2.5km and 4km - a bit overkill! These aid stations hand out water and isotonic juice in cups meaning you either have to slow down to drink it or accept that 90% of the liquid is ending up on your clothes. The run course was also hillier than I expected and in combination with it being the hottest day of the year so far, I found it tough! I dug in and on rounding the final corner was greeted with the finishing chute, a fantastic experience where all the pain seems to immediately vanish.</p>

<p>Finisher T-shirts acquired it was time to get back on a train and head back to London. The overall experience was thoroughly positive. Blenheim is a great first timers triathlon and is set up to accommodate complete novices like myself. Would I do it again? Not at the moment. This isn't because I don't think it's a great race but right now the idea of paying over £100 in entry fees plus travel expenses to race for 90 minutes doesn't seem too appealing. I think this year I will be targeting some longer races as well as some fun, cheap events.</p>
<p><strong>Best bit</strong>: The organisation and the venue. It's not every day you get to race around a Palace.</p>
<p><strong>Worst bit</strong>: I would have liked it if the waves were set off more strictly by ability, I found I didn't have many people around my level to push me.</p>
<p><strong>Top tip</strong>: Don't try and get the train, getting a car is worth it!</p>
