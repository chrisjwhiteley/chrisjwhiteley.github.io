            <description>A race report should probably be written in the days or weeks that follow a race. This one took place nearly 9 months ago but I hope someone will still be able to find some value in these ramblings.
In June 2019 I raced the Blenheim Palace Triathlon, my first triathlon of any length and, at the time, one of the most physically demanding activities I had undertaken. I was never overly athletic growing up, running didn&#39;t come naturally to me and whilst very comfortable in water, I certainly wasn&#39;t winning any races in the pool.</description>

<p>In June 2019 I raced the Blenheim Palace Triathlon, my first triathlon of any length and, at the time, one of the most physically demanding activities I had undertaken. I was never overly athletic growing up, running didn't come naturally to me and whilst very comfortable in water, I certainly wasn't winning any races in the pool. In 2018 I decided I would enter a 1 mile swimming race with a friend of mine. At the time this seemed truly bonkers but having survived the ordeal the natural progression seemed to be a sprint triathlon, and so on the 1st of June 2019 I found myself wheeling a bike into the grounds of Blenheim Palace, ready to race.</p>
<p>All my training for the race can be found on my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/19465229">Strava</a> profile along with my activities for the actual race which are linked below.</p>
<p><em>A note on travel to the race: I was travelling from London where people don't necessarily have cars. I thought I would be able to get a train and then find my way to the palace from Oxford. I was mistaken. After being thrown off the train I had initially booked for &lsquo;vandalising the seats&rsquo; (having my bike on board), I eventually managed to get on another train that got me to Oxford, I then ended up in a hugely overpriced taxi in order to get to the Palace grounds. Long story short, it's best to drive, rent a car if you don't have one!</em></p>
<p>The event was fantastically organised. After passing through the check in area I was told to drop my bike off in transition. At this point it became clear just how much of an experience range there was at this event. Some people were racing on £10,000 bikes whilst others were using mountain bikes which had clearly seen better days. After dropping my bike off and organising all my kit I went to get changed and before I knew it, it was time to get in the water and get racing.</p>

<p>The swim course was shaped like a number 7; starting from a floating start there was a long straight out followed by a short section back to the shore. I'd been told previously to take it easy on the swim and this is precisely what I did. Many people are surprised by how violent a triathlon swim can be but I managed to navigate this one without getting kicked in the face or ribs. Getting out of the water I felt fresh and ready to attack the rest of the course. The notorious climb up the hill to transition was a good opportunity for me to catch back up to people who had gone off hard in the swim and after a quick transition I was onto the bike. 1st leg successfully navigated!</p>

<p>Riding a bike in a wet trisuit was a new experience for me which was only made more pronounced by the initial downhill section out of the palace. Luckily the sun was beating down and within 5 minutes I was dry again. The bike course was hillier than I had expected although not unreasonably so. The course takes a loop of the palace estate and whilst perfectly pleasant, there are no views because you are in trees for most of the course. On the bike was where the gulf in class between athletes became very apparent with some athletes struggling to deal with the differing speeds. The 3 loop, 20km bike leg was over before I knew it and I was being directed back into transition to get changed into running shoes ready to take on the run.</p>
<p><a href="https://https://www.strava.com/activities/2413990895"><img src="/Blenheim/Bike.jpeg" alt="Strava Bike Course"></a></p>
<p>The run was where I knew I could empty myself in search of glory. It's a 5km course which means full gas from start to finish! The route is 2 loops around a portion of the lake. There are aid stations at 1.5km, 2.5km and 4km - a bit overkill! These aid stations hand out water and isotonic juice in cups meaning you either have to slow down to drink it or accept that 90% of the liquid is ending up on your clothes. The run course was also hillier than I expected and in combination with it being the hottest day of the year so far, I found it tough! I dug in and on rounding the final corner was greeted with the finishing chute, a fantastic experience where all the pain seems to immediately vanish.</p>

<p>Finisher T-shirts acquired it was time to get back on a train and head back to London. The overall experience was thoroughly positive. Blenheim is a great first timers triathlon and is set up to accommodate complete novices like myself. Would I do it again? Not at the moment. This isn't because I don't think it's a great race but right now the idea of paying over £100 in entry fees plus travel expenses to race for 90 minutes doesn't seem too appealing. I think this year I will be targeting some longer races as well as some fun, cheap events.</p>
<p><strong>Best bit</strong>: The organisation and the venue. It's not every day you get to race around a Palace.</p>
<p><strong>Worst bit</strong>: I would have liked it if the waves were set off more strictly by ability, I found I didn't have many people around my level to push me.</p>
<p><strong>Top tip</strong>: Don't try and get the train, getting a car is worth it!</p>

            <title>Setting goals for 2020</title>

            <description>Over the past couple of years i&#39;ve realised the power of speaking something into existence. This has mainly manifested itself in sporting goals but I think it&#39;s applicable to all areas of life. The accountability that you gain from putting your goals and ambitions out there for the world to see, really can&#39;t be understated. So here are my goals for 2020!
Tech Goals  Release Subtle Sports open-source..This is a project that I started over the summer when the Cricket World Cup was on.</description>

This has mainly manifested itself in sporting goals but I think it's applicable to all areas of life. The accountability that you gain from putting your goals and ambitions out there for the world to see, really can't be understated. So here are my goals for 2020!</p>
<h4 id="tech-goals-">Tech Goals</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Release Subtle Sports open-source.</strong>.This is a project that I started over the summer when the Cricket World Cup was on. It's a minimal sports tracker that let's you keep tabs on your favourite matches without having BBC Sport open constantly (read: track sports at work). More details to come on this in a future post.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute to an open-source project.</strong> I think it would be great to begin raising my external developer profile by contributing some code to a reputable open-source project. I'm on the hunt for something, any ideas please <a href="mailto:chriswhiteley5@gmail.com?subject=open-source%20contributions">get in touch.</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="sporting-goals-">Sporting Goals</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>5km sub-20 mins.</strong> Starting with the shortest distance, I want to go fast! Sub-20 minutes is the goal. My PB at the beginning of 2020 stands at 21.45 so there is a fair way to go.</li>
<li><strong>10km sub-45 mins.</strong> Moving to a slightly longer distance, I see this a stepping stone to goal 3.</li>
<li><strong>Half-Marathon sub-1hr 45.</strong> I've never run this far before but by the end of this year I want to be aiming to set a good time rather than purely complete the race.</li>
<li><strong>Run 1500km in total.</strong> The aim here is to encourage consistency. Last year I went through weeks/months of fantastic training but then would also have weeks where I do nothing. I want running to be an integral part of my life and setting a high mileage goal encourages me to remain consistent to avoid having to catch up.</li>
<li><strong>Half-Ironman.</strong> Definitely my &ldquo;A-race&rdquo; for 2020. I want to step up to the 70.3 distance. The aim here is mainly completion, but in a respectable time.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="self-improvement-goals-">Self-Improvement Goals</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Improve piano to a standard where I can play in front of people.</strong> I've wanted to pick the piano back up for the longest time, but it's really hard to learn the piano without owning a piano, so at the end of 2019 I bought one to remove that excuse. By the end of 2020 I want to have progressed to the point where I can sit down and play a piece that i'm proud of in front of my friends.</li>
<li><strong>Write 52 blog posts.</strong> I've always loved reading amateur opinion pieces on topics ranging from technology to sport. I find them to be so much more genuine than the media you see from major publications. 1 post a week should be possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are my goals. I'm excited to get started and I guess there will be a round-up post on here at the end of the year to see how i've done.</p>
